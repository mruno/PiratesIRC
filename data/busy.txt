sleepin' on the beach.
swimmin' with the fishes.
washin' ye pits.
wankin' it.
drunk in a muck pile.
lookin' fer rum.
addin' to a muck pile.
spankin' the monkey.
plannin' a mutiny.
cookin' some grub.
countin' ye booty.
cleanin' the cannons.
countin' the cannon balls.
riggin' the sails.
steerin' the ship.
sneakin' in some shut eye.
measurin' the ship's speed.
takin' a fix with the sextant.
spankin' the monkey.
plannin' a mutiny.
cookin' some grub.
