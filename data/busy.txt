swimmin' with the fishes.
washin' ye pits.
pickin' at ye feet.
drunk in a muck pile.
lookin' fer rum.
addin' to a muck pile.
skylarkin'.
cookin' some grub.
countin' ye booty.
cleanin' the cannons.
countin' the cannon balls.
riggin' the sails.
steerin' the ship.
sneakin' in some shut eye.
measurin' the ship's speed.
takin' a fix with the sextant.
cleanin' the bilge.
dreamin' o' booty.
lookin' fer booty.
loggin' ye escapades.
washin' ye feet.
